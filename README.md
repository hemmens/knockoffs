Description

This is a collection of Python scripts designed to generate pseudo-perfect knockoffs using linear algebra. There are three main tests corresponding to different sections of our paper:

A simple test for matching complex co-moments in linalg3.py,

a test using real-world data in the Swiss Stock Data folder,

and a comparison with the Metropolized Sampling algorithm presented by Bates, Cand√®s, Janson, and Wang (2020) in MH_Compare.

MH_Compare/t_core.py is available to ensure t_hemmens.py runs correctly. The original file can be found at the following link: https://github.com/wenshuow/metro/blob/f2c0b5c2eaf64d8759ab651d5aff4a787bcd9ae3/heavy-tailed-t/t_core.py
